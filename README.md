# Four_in_a_row

The project provides a Game Center application that allows users to play two classic games: Tic-Tac-Toe and 4-in-a-Row. The application supports both single-player and double-player modes, with an option to play against an AI opponent.  

 
The implementation follows an object-oriented design, utilizing classes such as `TicTacToeGame`, `FourInARowGame`, `Board`, `Cell`, and `Player` to model the game logic. The `Board` class represents the game board, while the `Cell` class represents individual cells on the board.  

 
The `Player` class is an abstract class with subclasses `HumanPlayer` and `AIPlayer`, which handle the moves made by human players and the AI opponent, respectively. The project demonstrates the use of various programming concepts, including loops, conditionals, arrays, and user input handling. The code is well-structured and organized, making it easy to understand and maintain.  
 

Overall, the Game Center project provides a gaming experience and serves as a good example of how to implement classic games using Java programming. It can be further enhanced by adding more features, improving AI strategies, and expanding the game options.
